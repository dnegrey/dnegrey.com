title: About
---

My name is Dan Negrey and I am a data scientist based in Cleveland, OH. My career has centered around marketing analytics but I am genuinely interested in all things data, especially when it involves the use of open-source technology. In particular, I love using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to build powerful data tools, dashboards and reports.

When not conversing about data science, you may find me opining about sports, video games, science fiction and popular culture. I am also a proud husband, father, animal lover and vegetarian.
