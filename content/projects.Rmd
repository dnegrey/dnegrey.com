#### Shiny

I love bringing data to life through interactive web applications! When [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) was first introduced years ago, I knew that it would become indispensable in my toolkit. I spent a lot of time early on learning the basics and trying my best to understand reactive programming, all while being fairly new to the principles of web development. Over time, I grew much more comfortable with Shiny, learning more advanced topics while also strengthening my R programming skills, becoming more familiar with data visualization packages and improving my software development abilities. In 2019, I built an app to track my family's weekly picks for the NFL regular season. This app won me a spot on the [System76 Superfan 3: Mission to Thelio](https://blog.system76.com/post/188835953849/winners-of-superfan-3-mission-to-thelio) (my proudest moment as an open-source data geek and an [experience](https://t.co/Cz50iQLTi6?amp=1) that I will never forget)! Be sure to check out [System76](https://system76.com/) if you're not already familiar - they are an awesome company, with great people, building amazing technology!

#### Professional Development

**[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)**

I am an advocate for massive open online courses ([MOOCs](https://www.mooc.org/)), and in particular, I have had great experiences with Coursera. Below are some of the courses I've taken and projects I've completed as part of those courses:

* [Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
    * Regression Models (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models" target="_blank">course</a> | <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera-uploads/user-c6cf595c99876d33669f141e/973762/asst-4/0d9ca7c0880211e4b2a3c70a976aa8ad.pdf" target="_blank">project</a>)
    * Practical Machine Learning (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning" target="_blank">course</a> | <a href="https://dnegrey.com/PML_CourseProject/writeup.html" target="_blank">project</a>)
    * Developing Data Products (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products" target="_blank">course</a> | <a href="https://dnegrey.shinyapps.io/courseProject/" target="_blank">project</a>)
    * Reproducible Research (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research" target="_blank">course</a> | <a href="https://rpubs.com/dnegrey/45114" target="_blank">project</a>)
* [Data Science at Scale Specialization offered by The University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science)
    * Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-manipulation" target="_blank">course</a>)

#### Other articles and presentations

**[Data Days CLE](https://www.datadayscle.org/)**

I was very fortunate to be invited to speak at the inaugural Data Days Cleveland conference in 2017. Data Days CLE is the regionâ€™s only conference focused on accessible data and civic technology for community impact. I gave a <a href="https://dnegrey.com/dataDaysCLE/main.html" target="_blank">presentation introducing R</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ls7WpDdzV18" target="_blank">spoke to attendees</a> about how open-source data science tools like R have become critical for data accessibility and community impact.

**[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dnegrey/)**

You're never too old to revisit the basics! This is an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/describing-your-data-understanding-distributions-dan-negrey" target="_blank">article I wrote back in 2015</a> that illustrates the fundamentals of using data distributions and summary statistics.
