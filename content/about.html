title: About
---



<p>My name is Dan Negrey and I am a data scientist based in Cleveland, OH. My career has centered around marketing analytics but I am genuinely interested in all things data, especially when it involves the use of open-source technology. In particular, I love using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> with <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> and <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> to build powerful data tools, dashboards and reports.</p>
<p>When not conversing about data science, you may find me opining about sports, video games, science fiction and popular culture. I am also a proud husband, father, animal lover and vegetarian.</p>
