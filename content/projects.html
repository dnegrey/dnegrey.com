<h4>Shiny</h4>
<p>I love bringing data to life through interactive web applications! When <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> was first introduced years ago, I knew that it would become indispensable in my toolkit. I spent a lot of time early on learning the basics and trying my best to understand reactive programming, all while being fairly new to the principles of web development. Over time, I grew much more comfortable with knowing how Shiny worked while also strengthening my R programming skills, familiarity with visualization packages and software development abilities in general. In 2019, I built an app to track my family’s weekly picks for the NFL regular season. This app won me a spot on the <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/188835953849/winners-of-superfan-3-mission-to-thelio">System76 Superfan 3: Mission to Thelio</a> (my proudest moment as an open-source data geek and an <a href="https://t.co/Cz50iQLTi6?amp=1">experience</a> that I will never forget)! Be sure to check out <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> if you’re not already familiar - they are an awesome company, with great people, building amazing technology!
