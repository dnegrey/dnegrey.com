<h4>Shiny</h4>
<p>I love bringing data to life through interactive web applications! When <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> was first introduced years ago, I knew that it would become indispensable in my toolkit. I spent a lot of time early on learning the basics and trying my best to understand reactive programming, all while being fairly new to the principles of web development. Over time, I grew much more comfortable with Shiny, learning more advanced topics while also strengthening my R programming skills, becoming more familiar with data visualization packages and improving my software development abilities. In 2019, I built an app to track my family’s weekly picks for the NFL regular season. This app won me a spot on the <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/188835953849/winners-of-superfan-3-mission-to-thelio">System76 Superfan 3: Mission to Thelio</a> (my proudest moment as an open-source data geek and an <a href="https://t.co/Cz50iQLTi6?amp=1">experience</a> that I will never forget)! Be sure to check out <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> if you’re not already familiar - they are an awesome company, with great people, building amazing technology!

<h4>Other articles and presentations</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.datadayscle.org/">Data Days CLE</a></strong></p>
<p>I was very fortunate to be invited to speak at the inaugural Data Days Cleveland conference in 2017. Data Days CLE is the region’s only conference focused on accessible data and civic technology for community impact. I gave a <a href="https://dnegrey.com/dataDaysCLE/main.html" target="_blank">presentation introducing R</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ls7WpDdzV18" target="_blank">spoke to attendees</a> about how open-source data science tools like R have become critical for data accessibility and community impact.</p>

<p>You’re never too old to revisit the basics! This is an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/describing-your-data-understanding-distributions-dan-negrey" target="_blank">article I wrote back in 2015</a> that illustrates the fundamentals of using data distributions and summary statistics.</p>
