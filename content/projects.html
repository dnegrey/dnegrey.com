<h4>Shiny</h4>
<p>I love bringing data to life through interactive web applications! When <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> was first introduced years ago, I knew that it would become indispensable in my toolkit. I spent a lot of time early on learning the basics and trying my best to understand reactive programming, all while being fairly new to the principles of web development. Over time, I grew much more comfortable with Shiny, learning more advanced topics while also strengthening my R programming skills, becoming more familiar with data visualization packages and improving my software development abilities. In 2019, I built an app to track my family’s weekly picks for the NFL regular season. This app won me a spot on the <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/188835953849/winners-of-superfan-3-mission-to-thelio">System76 Superfan 3: Mission to Thelio</a> (my proudest moment as an open-source data geek and an <a href="https://t.co/Cz50iQLTi6?amp=1">experience</a> that I will never forget)! Be sure to check out <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> if you’re not already familiar - they are an awesome company, with great people, building amazing technology!

<h4>Professional development</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a></strong></p>
<p>I am an advocate for massive open online courses (<a href="https://www.mooc.org/">MOOCs</a>), and in particular, I have had great experiences with Coursera. Below are some of the courses I’ve taken and projects I’ve completed as part of those courses:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification.html">SAS Global Certification</a></strong></p>
<p>Growth in the early part of my career was heavily dependent on learning the SAS programming language. Besides career advancement, however, I was very intrigued by making analytic processes more efficient - both in terms of reducing the time required for jobs to run as well as consolidating the code bases to be more concise. For each of these areas, mastering the SAS macro and SQL pass-through facilities was critical, and it started me down a path of analytical software engineering that has persisted throughout my career and is a key component of my professional approach.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://university.mongodb.com/">MongoDB University</a></strong></p>
<p>Some of the most eye-opening moments in my career have come while first learning about paradigm shifting technology. Indeed this was the case when I was first introduced to NoSQL databases like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> and <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>. Each of these companies offers a free community version of their product and a wealth of free training opportunities.</p>

<h4>Other articles and presentations</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.datadayscle.org/">Data Days CLE</a></strong></p>
<p>I was very fortunate to be invited to speak at the inaugural Data Days Cleveland conference in 2017. Data Days CLE is the region’s only conference focused on accessible data and civic technology for community impact. I gave a <a href="https://dnegrey.com/dataDaysCLE/main.html" target="_blank">presentation introducing R</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ls7WpDdzV18" target="_blank">spoke to attendees</a> about how open-source data science tools like R have become critical for data accessibility and community impact.</p>

<p>You’re never too old to revisit the basics! This is an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/describing-your-data-understanding-distributions-dan-negrey" target="_blank">article I wrote back in 2015</a> that illustrates the fundamentals of using data distributions and summary statistics.</p>
